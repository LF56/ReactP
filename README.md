# Description
This is my updated react portfolio. This was Module 20 challenge from UCF FullStack Coding Bootcamp. As this is the beginning of my react learning, I look foward to coming back and making this page even better!

# Install
To install this project on your device, clone my repo and then from there you can run `npm i` and `npm start`, or you can view my deployed site here!

# Usage
This project is for anyine to come and checkout my work. From my project, you are able to navigate to the footer and with the icons, be directed to my `Github`, `LinkedIn`, and `StackOverflow` accounts. Also, there is a clickable link to download my `resume`.
